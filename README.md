# Crop prediction using automated soil analysis
<h2>The Problem</h2>
According to a study, the agricultural sector employed about 50% of the workforce yet only contributed to 17-18% of Indiaâ€™s overall GDP. Soil testing can be a tedious task, inaccurate manual analysis could lead to loss of crops and low productivity infertility of soil. Moreover, improper agricultural practices such as planting wrong crops not only causes monetary loss to farmer but also leads to soil degradation and affects the environment in the long term
<h2>Solution</h2>
To determine the soil characteristics we require the use of a robot crane with sensors such as NPK, temperature, humidity, tilt and moisture. The measured data is run through machine learning model and a report is produced which determines the best crop to grow in the given soil
